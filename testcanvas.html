        Image Classification using Flowers dataset
        This tutorial uses the Flowers dataset to build a customized image classification model via transfer learning and the existing Inception-v3 model in order to correctly label different types of flowers using Cloud Machine Learning Engine.
        
        The sample code you will walk through and results you will monitor consist of four parts: data preprocessing, model training with the transformed data, model deployment, and prediction request steps. All parts will be completed in the cloud.
        
        What you will build
        You will run sample code in order to preprocess data with Cloud Dataflow and then use that transformed data to train a model with Cloud ML Engine. You will then deploy the trained model to Cloud ML Engine and test the model by sending a prediction request to it.
        
        In this sample dataset you only have a small set of images (~3,600). Without more data it isn’t possible to use machine learning techniques to adequately train an accurate classification model from scratch. Instead, you’ll use an approach called transfer learning. In transfer learning you use a pre-trained model to extract image features that you will use to train a new classifier. In this tutorial in particular you’ll use a pre-trained model called Inception.
        
        Note: You can use Cloud Vision API to quickly get information about images. This is particularly helpful if you do not want to train your own model, or don’t need to create your own unique classification categories. However, Cloud Vision API isn't appropriate for creating target categories (flower types, in this case) as you will in this walkthrough.
        Objectives
        In this introductory, end-to-end walkthrough you will use python code to:
        
        Perform data preprocessing in the cloud, reading original data files and using Cloud Dataflow to convert them into TFRecord format for training.
        Run training using Cloud Machine Learning Engine to obtain optimal model specifications.
        Deploy the trained model.
        Request a prediction from the trained model and observe the resulting accuracy.
        Costs
        This walkthrough uses billable components of Google Cloud Platform, including:
