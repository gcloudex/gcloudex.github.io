See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for instruction.

  - open browser and go to `localhost:4000` to show the home page
  - any new changes should be reflected immediately after the site regenerated


## Adding Posts

To make Blog post, or refinements, it would be helpful to understand what Markdown is and how to write it. Markdown is just a way to take a piece of text and format it to look a little nicer.  For example, this whole instruction set that you're reading is written in markdown - it's just text with some words being bold/larger/italicized/etc. I recommend taking 5 minutes to learn markdown [with this amazingly easy yet useful tutorial](https://markdowntutorial.com/).  

All posts are stored in the `_posts` folder with filename format `year-month-day-title.md`. See [Jekyll - Posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) for how to write a post.
